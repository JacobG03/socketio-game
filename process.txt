1. Homepage:
    1. No login/register, just username.
    2. Display Open, 2v2, Change username, Change image (from color to picture or gif, max 128x128)

2. Game:
    2v2:
        1. After choosing 2v2 display new content with an arrow that allows to go back.
        2. Display: Quick search (join a public open game), 
                    invite by link (will display a new game 
                        but showing the user that it's clearly waiting for someone to join and whether its public or private)
    Open:
        Chasing person changes color to black or is highlited.
        When a user joines:
            HTML & CSS: Display a wating circle gif and say: Joining..
            Javascript:
                Check amount of users by class 'user'.
                Create player with that length as id.
                Rewrite code in a way that than the user controls that new created element. Not someone elses.
                Game will be validated by every client, not server side.
                JS functions that will check the score, player positions etc.
                

    Some data will have to be saved as cookies, no database
    Reduce spamming by calling a function after making a step that will 
        change a global variable can_move to false for x amount of time and back to true.
    Display all necessary info about the game. (score, public/private, who is what color etc.)

TODO:
Check how to save web page with javascript ip/change_username etc.
Check how to save cookies properly
Finish username change html (add go back button)
Add all necessary javascript:
    -change display on click,
    -change username on enter,
    -display notification that username has been changed,
    -update 'current: username'
    -save username in cookies,
    -save page state,


Also add animations, later though


Seperate site idea:
Generate random colors but all must differ as much as possible.
